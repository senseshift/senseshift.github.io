# Connection issues

This guide will help you troubleshoot issues of your ESP32 not connecting to bHaptics Player

## Troubleshooting steps

1. Try connecting to other platforms, than your current environment (such as your *Android* or *iOS* phone, *Meta Quest*, or a friend's computer). This will help you determine if the problem is specific to your current environment or if it is a more general issue.
   - **If your connected** to other platforms successfully, proceed to [BLE Drivers](#ble-drivers) section.
2. Try using other versions of firmware:
   - Flash previous versions of firmware, if you are using [WebSerial Flasher](../firmware/web-flasher.mdx). **If previous version connects**, please submit a *regression* bug report.
   - Verify issue still exists on latest `master` and `develop` branches of firmware. Follow [PlatformIO Guide](../firmware/platformio.md) to build and flash latest version, and then try connecting again to see if the issue has been resolved
3. If you have another ESP32 board available, try using that board to see if the connection issue persists.
   This will help you determine if the problem is specific to your current board or if it is a more general issue.
   - If the issue persists, consider purchasing a new ESP32 board from one of our [verified sources](/docs/hardware/mcu#esp32-recommended-sources);
4. If you are still experiencing connection issues, search for help on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/YUtRKAqty2).

   * Make sure that your device supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
   * Check the specifications of your Bluetooth adapter to see if it supports **BLE 4.1**
3. Disable interference:
   * Move your ESP32 board and computer closer together to minimize interference.
