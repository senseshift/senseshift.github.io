# ERM

ERM stands for **eccentric rotating mass** and relies on small unbalanced mass attached to the DC motor axle that creates a displacement force when rotating.

## ERM types

:::note
All categories were made up in the context of applying them in OpenHaptics

### Coin ERMs

The main advantage of Coin ERMs is their size &mdash; Coin ERMs are typically very small, in exchange for very weak feedback.

Coin ERMs drove with 3V, but can be operated with 5V, though drawing much more current.

### Cylindrical ERMs

Cylindrical ERMs (also Coreless ERMs) are a step up from Coin ERMs. They provide much stronger feedback, usually drawing the same current as Coin ERMs in exchange for a bigger sizes.

#### Example Cylindrical ERMs

* KPD7C-0716

### Cored ERMs

Cored ERMs provide the strongest feedback of them all, in exchange for their bulky size and larger current draw. Cored ERMs often rely on *brushes*, which **may cause sparks**.

## Applying ERMs

:::note
There is no strict rules, how to apply different actuators, just a recommendation, based on personal experience.

| ERM type                | Feedback Force | Vest | Glove | Facial Interface | Other wearable |
| :---------------------- | :------------- | :--: | :---: | :--------------: | :------------: |
| Coin ERM (3V)           | Weakest        | ❌   | ✅    | ✅              | ✅             |
| Coin ERM (5V)           | Weak           | ✅   | ✅    | ✅              | ✅             |
| Cylindrical (3V/5V)     | Medium         | ✅   | ❌    | ❌              | ✅             |
| Cored Motor (3V/5V/12V) | Strong         | ✅   | ❌    | ❌              | ❌             |

## Wiring ERMs

Most ERM actuators, even the smallest Coin ERMs, draw much more, than safe 20mA, that can be provided by ESP32, so **using a transistor is required** to wire an ERM actuator.

In most cases, when building DIY OpenHaptics devices, using **ULN2803A** Darlington transistor array is the best way since it can power 8 devices at the same time, which pairs nicely with **PCA9685** 16-channel PWM driver.

Since ERMs rely on PWM signal, following **PWM drivers** can be used:

* Internal PWM generator
* PCA9685
