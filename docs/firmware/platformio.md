# PlatformIO IDE

Flash SenseShift firmware using VSCode and PlatformIO IDE

## Prerequisites

1. Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode): [Download][vscode]
2. Download PlatformIO here: [Download][pio]
3. *Recommended:* Git for Windows: [Download][git-windows]; other OS: https://git-scm.com/downloads
4. Install drivers: [Guide](./drivers)

### Download and Install VSCode

Download the [latest Visual Studio Code][vscode] and install it.

### Install PlatformIO IDE

Once Visual Studio Code is installed, open it and install [PlatformIO IDE for VSCode][pio], an extension that will allow you to connect to the MCU, build and upload the firmware.

### *Recommended:* Install Git client {#install-git-client}

:::info
This step is optional but highly recommended. By installing the Git client, you will be able to update your firmware without the need to project archive it again.
:::

For Windows, you can download and install [Git for Windows][git-windows]. If you have other OS, visit https://git-scm.com/downloads.

:::note
You will most likely have to click *‚ÄúClick here to download manually‚Äù*. If that doesn‚Äôt work, you can try [here](https://gitforwindows.org/).

## Open Firmware project

### Option 1: Clone Git repository

If you've [installed optional Git client](#install-git-client), you can clone the firmware project with Git.

Make sure you close any current projects you have open or open a new window before moving forward with these steps:

1. Click the Source Control button, click on Clone Repository and enter: `https://github.com/senseshift/senseshift-firmware.git`.  
   If you installed git while Visual Studio Code was open you may have to close it and re-open it first.

2. Once you have chosen a download location click the **Open button** that appears at the bottom right.

3. Click **Yes, I trust the authors**.

### Option 2: Open project ZIP

If you've decided not to download Git client, you can download latest firmware as ZIP and open it with following steps

1. Download [latest firmware archive](https://github.com/senseshift/senseshift-firmware/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unzip it in any folder.
2. Click **Open Folder** button in File section and select directory with unzipped firmware.

3. Click **Yes, I trust the authors**.

## Building and uploading firmware

Open project directory (extract archive if needed) in VSCode with PlatformIO extension and choose desired firmware target
Flash it using either **quick actions**, or by running `Flash` command from **Project Tasks** list (see screenshot below)

  <summary>GUI Actions</summary>

  1. PlatformIO IDE homepage
  2. Select desired firmware mode and run command (Build, Upload or Monitor) in **Project Tasks**
  3. Use **quick actions** (`‚úîÔ∏è - Build`, `‚û°Ô∏è - Upload`, `üîå - Monitor`). Choose your default mode by clicking `Default (senseshift-firmware)` and switching your default

</details>

## Customizing and editing firmware {#customizing}

If your setup requires additional changes, select best suiting target, and edit it's source code. All firmware files are configured in `platformio.ini` and `ini/bhaptics.ini` files. Read more about configuration [here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/index.html).

### Changing pins

Your device source files are located in [`firmware/mode_configs/bhaptics` directory](https://github.com/senseshift/senseshift-firmware/tree/master/firmware/mode_configs/bhaptics). In the files there you can find following lines of code:

```cpp
...
auto frontOutputs = mapMatrixCoordinates<AbstractOutputWriter>({
   {new PWMOutputWriter(32), new PWMOutputWriter(33), new PWMOutputWriter(25), new PWMOutputWriter(26)},
   {new PWMOutputWriter(27), new PWMOutputWriter(14), new PWMOutputWriter(12), new PWMOutputWriter(13)},
});
auto backOutputs = mapMatrixCoordinates<AbstractOutputWriter>({
   {new PWMOutputWriter(19), new PWMOutputWriter(18), new PWMOutputWriter(5), new PWMOutputWriter(17)},
   {new PWMOutputWriter(16), new PWMOutputWriter(4), new PWMOutputWriter(2), new PWMOutputWriter(15)},
});
...

```

The numbers are your output pins, and their location in the configuration matrix corresponds to the physical location of the motors on your device.
