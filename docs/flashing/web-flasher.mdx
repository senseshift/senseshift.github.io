# WebSerial Flasher

Flash firmware using Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Opera browser

:::danger

WebSerial Flasher is in very early stages of alfa testing. There is absolutely no warranty, take actions at your OWN risk.
I will not be responsible for any damages associated with this tool.

:::

## Prerequisites

1. Use **Chrome 89+**, **Microsoft Edge 89+**, **Opera 76+** or any other [supported browser](https://caniuse.com/web-serial).
2. Install drivers: [Guide](./drivers)

## Flash firmware

<WebSerialProvider>
  <FlashFirmware />
</WebSerialProvider>

## Customizing and editing firmware

:::note

**Unfortunately, it is impossible to customize firmware** at this point, if you planning to flash it using WebSerial Flasher.

Use [PlatformIO](./platformio) instead

:::

I'm currently working on newer version, that will allow you to customize all the components and motor layout, and flash firmware, that suits you the best!
You can keep track of it in this [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/openhaptics/openhaptics-firmware/milestone/4)
